[Web Server Installation]

In addition to running the install.sh script to copy the component files, you need to have a working
httpd+mod_ssl+mod_php setup that runs a host under $WEBPATH/html/dynamo. With apache, this is achieved
by the following configurations:

| . /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
| 
| <VirtualHost *:80>
|   ServerName *your_host_name*
|   DocumentRoot /var/www/html/dynamo
|   ErrorLog logs/dynamo-error_log
| 
|   <Directory "/var/www/html/dynamo">
|     Options -Indexes
|   </Directory>
| </VirtualHost>
| 
| . /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf (need mod_ssl to be installed)
| 
| <VirtualHost *:443>
|   ServerName *your_host_name*
|   DocumentRoot /var/www/html/dynamo
|   ErrorLog logs/dynamo-ssl_error_log
| 
|   SSLCertificateFile /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem
|   SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem
|   SSLCACertificatePath /etc/grid-security/certificates
|   SSLCARevocationPath /etc/grid-security/certificates
|   SSLCARevocationCheck chain
|   SSLVerifyClient require
|   SSLVerifyDepth  10
| 
|   <Directory "/var/www/html/dynamo">
|     Options -Indexes
|     Order deny,allow
|     Allow from all
|   </Directory>
|   
|   <Directory "/var/www/cgi-bin/dynamo">
|     SSLOptions +StdEnvVars 
|   </Directory>
|   
|   <Directory "/var/www/cgi-bin/registry">
|     SSLOptions +StdEnvVars 
|   </Directory>
| </VirtualHost>

For files with no .php extension to work as PHP scripts, we need

| . /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
| 
| <Directory "/var/www/html">
| ...
|   AllowOverride FileInfo Options AuthConfig
| ...
| </Directory>

so that /var/www/html/dynamo/registry/.htaccess can work.

For registry task upload, interface.php must be able to write to the spool directory. This operation
is typically blocked by SELinux. Repeat the upload attempt and

| ausearch -c httpd | audit2allow -M myhttpd
| semodule -i myhttpd.pp

multiple times to have all necessary SELinux exceptions installed.

Finally, httpd must accept X509 certificate proxies. In SysV (<= SL6), edit

| . /etc/init.d/httpd
| 
| if [ -f /etc/sysconfig/httpd ]; then
|         . /etc/sysconfig/httpd
| fi
| 
| ## ADD THIS BLOCK HERE
| # Allow authentication by proxy certificates
| export OPENSSL_ALLOW_PROXY_CERTS=1
| ## ADD THIS BLOCK HERE
| 
| # Start httpd in the C locale by default.
| HTTPD_LANG=${HTTPD_LANG-"C"}

In systemd (>= CentOS 7), edit

| . /etc/sysconfig/httpd
| 
| ## AT THE END OF THE FILE
| OPENSSL_ALLOW_PROXY_CERTS=1
