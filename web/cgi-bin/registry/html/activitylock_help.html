    <h1>Dynamo application locks API</h1>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>
      This API is used to block / unblock execution of dynamo applications. Each Dynamo application creates and
      holds a lock while it executes. External entities that need to block dynamo execution for a period of time can request
      to lock its applications. Locks are identified by the application name, requesting user, and optionally the
      "service name". Service name is used if a user is managing locks in behalf of some system (e.g. Unified).
      Only users and services with permissions can make changes to the lock database (read-only functions are available to
      everyone). Please write a message to the HN hn-cms-dmDevelopment (DataManagement Developers) to obtain a
      permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is NO browser-friendly interface for application locks at the moment, aside from this manual page. Use
      cURL to access the API:
      <pre>
        curl --cert <i>proxy</i> --key <i>proxy</i> 'https://dynamo.mit.edu/registry/applock/<i>command</i>[?<i>options</i>]'
      </pre>
      where <i>proxy</i> is a valid CMS grid proxy and <i>command</i> is one of the commands listed below. <br>
      <span style="color:red;">Note that authentication with grid proxies work only with cURL+OpenSSL, which is not the default build in Scientific Linux and CentOS. CMS environment sourced from CVMFS provides a working configuration.</span>
    </p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Lock detox:
        <pre>
          applock/lock?app=detox
        </pre>
        When the lock is successful, an "OK" message is sent back as a JSON string. If the application is already locked by
        another user, a "WAIT" message is sent back. In this case, the lock is registered in the queue and will become active as soon
        as the previous locks are removed. This command can be issued multiple times to poll the change from "WAIT" to "OK" - there will
        always be only one lock from a user+service registered in the queue at a time.
      </li>
      <li>Lock detox as a service user "prodsystem":
        <pre>
          applock/lock?service=prodsystem&amp;app=detox
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>Unlock detox:
        <pre>
          applock/unlock?app=detox
        </pre>
        Only locks created by your user name and service name can be released.
      </li>
      <li>Check the lock status:
        <pre>
          applock/check
        </pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
